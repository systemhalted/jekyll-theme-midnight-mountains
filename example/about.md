Midnight Mountains is a calm, dark theme built for long reads and sharp imagery. The layout pairs a featured story with a grid of posts, so the latest update always leads the page.

This demo is a small sample site with a few posts and simple pages. Use it to verify layouts, typography, and image treatments while you iterate on the theme.
